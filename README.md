# aws-s3-glue-athena-pipeline
An AWS Data Engineering Project using S3, Glue, and Athena

This project demonstrates how to build a basic data lake architecture using Amazon S3, AWS Glue for ETL, and Amazon Athena for querying.

Goals
Upload sample data to Amazon S3
Run ETL jobs with AWS Glue
Query data with Amazon Athena
Learn IAM setup and permission control
Document and visualize the pipeline

Tech Stack
AWS  - Data Storage
AWS Glue   -  ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
AWS Athena - SQL-based querying
IAM  - access and roles
Python/PySpark -used in Glue jobs
GitHub - version control and portfolio

# Learning Milestones
- Create an S3 bucket and upload sample data
- Create an IAM role with  Glue and S3 permissions
- Create a Glue crawler and job
- Run transformation and script (Python or PySpark)
- Query output using Athena
- Document each step with screenshots

- # Screenshots (to be added later)
- Add screenshots for:
- S3 bucket setup
- Glue job and crawler config
- Athena query results
